~~~~~~~~~~

A module to implement the stochastic gradient descent learning
algorithm for a feed-forward neural network.  Gradients are calculated
using back-propagation.  Note that I have focused on making the code
simple, easily readable, and easily modifiable.  It is not optimized,
and omits many desirable features.
