# Code samples for "Neural Networks and Deep Learning"

This repository contains code samples for the book ["Neural Networks
and Deep Learning"](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com) as well as my solutions for some of the problems in it.

## Chapter 2

### Fully matrix-based approach

My solution for the problem in Chapter 2: "Fully matrix-based approach to back-propagation over a mini-batch"
is in [`src/network_matrix_based.py`](`src/network_matrix_based.py`).

Original implementation by the author performed as `cProfile` shows below:

```text
54861403 function calls (54857353 primitive calls) in 485.136 seconds
```

```text
ncalls   tottime  percall  cumtime   percall  filename:lineno(function)
150000   21.762   0.000    452.468   0.003    network.py:74(update_mini_batch)
```

### Solution

Taking advantage of linear algebra, my proposed approach performed quite a bit faster
than looping over the mini-batch:

```text
16159577 function calls (16155527 primitive calls) in 133.310 seconds
```

```text
ncalls   tottime  percall  cumtime   percall  filename:lineno(function)
150000   2.278    0.000    104.758   0.001    network_matrix_based.py:94(update_mini_batch)
```
